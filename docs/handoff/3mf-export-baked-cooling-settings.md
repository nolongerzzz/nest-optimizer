## 3MF export - baked cooling settings
`nso-cooling-profiles.js` + `nso-3mf.js`, wired into `app-core.js` (the
export-format block and the `export3MF` block) and `app-join.js` / `app-ux.js`
(the buttons and the right-click item). Full write-up:
`docs/baked-cooling-settings.md`.

Unlike repair / sculpt / planar fuse, this one **is** wired in. The entry point
is one **Format** selector (STL / 3MF) at the top of the Export card, remembered
in `localStorage` as `nso.exportFormat`. It drives **Download selected**,
**Export plate** and the right-click **Export** item alike, relabelling them; the
cooling-profile row only shows for 3MF. There is no separate 3MF button any more
(`#btn-export-3mf` is gone; the plate button keeps its `#btn-export-stl` id
because app-cut.js and app-core.js enable/disable it by that id). "Download
selected" with 3MF is `exportActiveModel3MF()`: the active model as a one-object
project, same axis swap and bad-triangle filter as `exportActiveModel()`, set
down centred on the current plate resting on z = 0, same filename prompt.

`main` (the live site) has none of this yet - no 3MF modules, no Format
selector; that is a `claude-wip` -> `main` merge, Grok's call.
