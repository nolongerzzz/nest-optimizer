## Grispr - per-object fan control (G-code post-process, NOT wired in)

`tools/grispr/grispr.py`, standalone Python 3, stdlib only. Full write-up:
`tools/grispr/README.md`. Suite: `npm run grispr:test` (82 tests, 16 synthetic
fixtures, plus 60 randomised layouts). Deliberately not in `npm test` - like
repair / sculpt / planar fuse it is unwired, and `npm test` is all-node today.

**NEXT CHECK - ANSWERED 2026-09-14, non-zero.** A real 2-object slice
(567,481 lines, 113 layers, objects 197 and 237) carries 336 balanced
`start/stop printing object` pairs, 113 layer manifests and 898 `M624`/`M625`
lines. The single-object file had none of those. So Bambu emits the labelling
machinery only for plates with more than one object, real multi-object plates
land in LABEL mode, and the inferred path only ever sees single-object files -
where per-object fan control is moot anyway. The write-refusal on multi-object
inferred files stays, as a guard against a shape that may not occur rather than
one expected to fire. Nothing had to be lifted: that refusal was always scoped
to `marker_mode == "object_id"`, so labelled multi-object writes were never
blocked.

Validated on that file: `--list` reads 336 blocks in label mode and flags true
interleave on essentially every layer. Targeting object 197 alone, object 237's
116 blocks spanning 389,156 lines show ZERO fan-state leaks, every one of the
567,482 original lines survives byte-identical and in order, and `--force`
reverts the 13.5 MB file byte-for-byte. First real-data proof of the no-leak
claim.

**It corrected a premise this module was built on.** The kickoff said fan state
is untouched at object transitions. It is not: 273 of that file's 335
transitions carry a fan command. Bambu wraps the layer-change/timelapse section
in `M106 S255` ... `M106 S<ambient>` with `M624`/`M625` masks around each block.
Those belong to the layer change, not to either object, so they sit between
blocks and Grispr leaves them alone - but they are one more thing overwriting a
forced value, which reinforces the --hold finding rather than softening it.

It is the advanced-mode companion to the baked cooling exporter, not an
alternative to it. The exporter owns the single-profile whole-plate case.
Grispr owns what the 3MF schema cannot express at all: per-object fan. It runs
as a Bambu Studio post-processing script (Others tab), so it depends on no
filament-preset state and cannot be dropped by "Discard Modified Value".

Two decisions that must not be "tidied up":

- **Boundary injection is the default.** Grispr injects at an object's start
  marker and restores at its stop marker, and leaves every `M106`/`M107` the
  slicer emitted INSIDE the object alone, because those include Bambu's native
  overhang/bridge forcing (`enable_overhang_bridge_fan`, already baked in by
  the exporter). `--hold` suppresses them and is opt-in precisely because it
  defeats that forcing. Do not make `--hold` the default.
- **The restore value is computed, never a constant.** At each stop marker it
  is the fan state the UNMODIFIED file would have had at that line. Objects
  interleave within a layer and an object can be re-entered on the same layer,
  so restoring to "the value before the block" would leak state into whoever
  prints next. Measured case, from the fixtures: object 2 raises the fan to
  S255 for an overhang mid-block, object 3 then prints on the same layer and
  correctly gets S255 back, not the S102 layer ambient.

Pass/fail is the leak invariant, not eyeballing injection points: for every
line outside a targeted object's block, the fan state in the output must equal
the original file's state at that same line. Checked line by line, every
fixture, every target combination, with and without `--hold`.

### Flagged at the 3MF exporter: `identify_id` is not written

`buildModelSettings()` in `nso-3mf.js` writes `<object id="N">`, a `name`
metadata, and a `model_instance` carrying `object_id`. It does not write
`identify_id`. `grep -rn identify_id` over this repo hits only this entry and
Grispr's own docs - no code writes it.

Grispr targets the G-code `unique label id`, which is Bambu's `identify_id` for
that object. So NSO controls the object ORDER it writes into the 3MF, not the
id Bambu stamps into the sliced G-code, and the chain

    NSO internal object -> 3MF identify_id -> G-code unique label id

is open at the first link. This does not block using Grispr - ids come from the
command line, read off `--list` - but it does block automating the hand-off.

Two ways to close it, exporter's call:

1. Write `identify_id` explicitly in `buildModelSettings()`. Only works if
   Bambu honours an incoming value on load instead of reassigning it.
2. Confirm empirically that Bambu's assignment is predictable from load order,
   then pin that as a documented assumption with a check behind it.

Either is a change to the exporter, not to Grispr, and neither has been tested.
The same real-Bambu-Studio session that verifies the baked cooling values can
settle it in one pass: export a 3-object plate, open it, slice it, and read the
`; start printing object, unique label id:` values back against the object
order NSO wrote.

### Real file, run 2026-09-14 - three defects found, all fixed

107,548 lines, 105 layers, one object (`; OBJECT_ID: 518`), stock Bambu PLA
Basic. Findings, in order of how much they mattered:

1. **The file has no start/stop object markers at all.** 105 `; OBJECT_ID: 518`
   comments, zero `start printing object` / `stop printing object`, zero
   `object ids of layer`. Grispr exited 3 and wrote nothing - correct
   fail-loud behaviour, but it could not read the file. It now has a second
   marker mode that infers block ends from `; OBJECT_ID:` / `; CHANGE_LAYER` /
   `; EXECUTABLE_BLOCK_END`. `--list` names which mode it used.
   Note the terminator is the layer change, NOT the timelapse block: the
   object's toolpath resumes after `; SKIPPABLE_END` and the sparse infill
   after it belongs to the object.
2. **The last inferred block swallowed the end gcode**, which contains
   `M106 S0 ; turn off fan` plus the P2/P3 shutdowns. Under `--hold` those
   would have been commented out and the fan left running after the print.
   Inferred blocks are now clamped to the file's last extruding move, which
   fixes it without depending on any comment.
3. **Fan speeds are fractional** - `M106 S196.35` appears 1222 times - and the
   file never uses `M107`, it writes `M106 S0`. Restores were rounding to int
   and could introduce an `M107` the file never used. Both fixed.

The measured number that matters for the module's story:

    105 block(s) across 1 object(s); 105 forced, 23 restored, 5694 suppressed

5694 of the file's 5735 fan commands sit INSIDE object blocks - about 54 per
layer, mostly overhang forcing driving `M106 S255` (2856 occurrences). So
boundary injection, the default, is overridden within a few lines on real
Bambu output. `--hold` is the only mode that does anything lasting on a file
like this. That is measured, not estimated, and it is the opposite of what the
default implies - see limitation 2 in `tools/grispr/README.md`.

Verification on the real file: full `--hold` run, output re-parses to the same
105 blocks, `--force` reverts byte-for-byte to the original (5823 lines
undone), end-gcode fan shutdown still executable.

### Still open on the real-file front

That plate was SINGLE object. Closed by the 2-object slice - see NEXT CHECK at
the top of this entry. The `exclude_object = 1` with no start/stop markers and
no `M624`/`M625` was the tell, and it held.

Grispr refuses to WRITE to an inferred-mode file with more than one distinct
object id, because the block-end guess is verified for the single-object shape
only. `--list` still works on it.

### The original pending note, kept for the record

`--list` had never been run on a real sliced file before 2026-09-14. The marker pattern is
confirmed against genuine Bambu output; Grispr's parser against that pattern is
not. Next slice off either printer:

    python3 tools/grispr/grispr.py --list /path/to/plate_1.gcode

Ping-pong analogue to the bare STL drop: a bare `.gcode` drop, no text, means
"run `--list` on this". Expect the block table; a parse error or an obviously
wrong block count IS the finding. Safe to run on anything - `--list` never
writes, and Grispr exits non-zero without touching the file on any pattern it
does not recognise, rather than reporting a zero-edit success.
