## Archive — Soften Corners second pass (corners2), historical

corners1 was measured on the exported STL of the live FAIL. What it actually
built, on the 12.38 x 20 x 20 baked half at R=2.5:

- All FOUR cap-loop corners carried an arc of exactly radius 2.5 (tangent at
  7.5 on each edge, centres at (+/-7.5, +/-7.5)). Watertight, 0 open, 0
  non-manifold. So "one pair only" is not in the mesh — but the shape was
  still wrong, in two ways that explain what it looked like:
- **Orbit-point.** The corner surface converged radially on the ORIGINAL
  sharp apex at depth 1.0355 — every rollover sample ran to one vertex, so
  the corner is a cone apex, not a fillet. From any camera off the face
  normal it reads as a point.
- **Bite too small.** corners1 rounded the lid boundary in plan with radius
  R but only cut the wall back by R/sin(45) - R = 0.4142 R. At R=2.5 that is
  a 1.04mm bite where 2.5mm was asked.

corners2 put Corners back through `rawEdgeRoundInPlace`. That work is already
on main as later corners tickets. Do not re-open it from this archive.

### Known, not current
`branch point in cap boundary` still refuses some cut faces (parked
`stash@{0}`) — Round, Bevel and Corners all refuse there identically.
`stash@{0}` stays parked until an explicit **APPLY**.
