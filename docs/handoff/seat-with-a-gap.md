## Seat with a gap (2026-09-16)
`app-join.js`, `NSO_seatFlushBitToHull` and two buttons in the Join card:
**Seat flush** (the plug seat, never reads the slider) and **Seat (support)**
with the gap **slider** `#seat-gap` (`-0.25 .. +0.05` mm by `0.01`, default
`-0.18`, mid easy-release) and its exact readout `#seat-gap-value`. Check:
`npm run seat:gap` (`tools/nso_seat_gap_test.js`, in `npm test`).

*History:* the gap first shipped as a number field beside a single Seat flush
button (blank = flush, number = gap). Split 2026-09-16 into the two buttons
above so the flush path can never be reached with a stale number in a field,
and the slider replaces typing: 0.01 steps sweep the plateau-to-weld boundary
(`-0.25` air .. `+0.05` overlap) without sub-hundredth noise. The bullets
below say "gap field" where they predate the split; read "slider".

**What Seat did before this.** It was never flush-only and it never had a
"gap". The core always took `opts.proud` (default 0.4): the distance the bit's
OUTER face - the one facing away from the hull - ends up outside the hull
skin. The button hardcoded `{ proud: 0.01 }`. So "Seat 0.01" on a real part
meant: bury the bit in the hull until its outer face stands 0.01 mm proud of
the skin, ready for Subtract to carve the pocket. Measured before the change
on `box_hull_80x40x20-2` + `box-20mm`: bit top 0.01 mm above the hull top,
bit bottom 19.99 mm below it. That is a plug seat, not a surface seat, and
`proud` is the wrong quantity for a breakaway piece.

**What changed.** A second, exclusive option: `{ gap: g }`. `g` positions the
bit's MATING face (the one facing the hull) off the skin, in the sign
convention `tools/breakaway_coupons.py` locked in its JSON
(`gap_overlap_mm`): **negative = air gap of that size, positive = the bit
penetrates the hull by that much, 0 = touching**. Easy release is
`{ gap: -0.18 }` (locked range -0.15 .. -0.20). Same corner rays, same tilt
fit, same translate along the fitted normal; only the reference face and the
sign differ. Passing `gap` together with `proud` or `lip` is refused. The
result carries `mode`, `gapAchieved`, `gapMin`, `gapMax` (coupon convention)
alongside the old keys. The flush path (`proud`) is byte-identical: the test
pins the pre-change pose to 1e-9 and the status line to the character.

**The buttons.** Seat flush = the old flush seat, unchanged (status
`Seated - proud 0.01mm ...`), whatever the slider shows - the test drags the
slider to +0.05 and clicks it, golden pose to 1e-9. Seat (support) = gap seat
at the slider's value, status
`Seated - air gap 0.18mm (measured -0.180mm, skin error 0.00mm)`; the
measured value keeps its sign so a wrong-way seat can never read as right.
The slider is the control; arrow keys step 0.01, the readout shows the exact
value the next click will use, and a value set from code outside the range
clamps (the browser's own range sanitisation) so the readout and the seat
can never disagree. Seat (support) with the slider missing refuses.

**Two things the gap path does that the flush path does not.**
1. It settles the hull onto the bed baseline first (`settlePlacedOnBed`, what
   Align edges already does via `matchPlacedBottoms`). A dropped, never-moved
   piece sits 0.1 mm higher than a settled one, and `liftY` - what the exports
   write - is measured from the settled baseline. Left alone, that 0.1 mm
   would have landed in the exported gap; the whole easy-release window is
   0.05 mm wide.
2. Both plate exports (`buildCombinedGeometry` for STL, `buildPlacedObjects3MF`
   for 3MF in `app-core.js`) now add `liftY` to the piece's height. Before,
   every piece exported resting on z = 0 whatever the scene showed, so a
   seated gap - or any Lift - was silently dropped from the file the slicer
   gets. An unlifted piece exports exactly as before (the 3MF drive check's
   "rests on z = 0" gate still holds).

**Validation numbers (gap -0.18, real button, real export, canonical checker
`tools/mesh_validate.py --json`).** Scene: mating face +0.180001 mm above the
skin (the 7.6e-7 is the hull's Float32 soup). Export: 40 triangles, 0 open,
0 non-manifold edges, volume 71360.000 = hull 63360 + bit 8000, 0 piercing
pairs, 0 coplanar pairs, bbox height 40.18; the two shells split off the STL
are 0.1800003 mm apart; 3MF objects the same. Controls: +0.05 puts the
mating face 0.05 mm inside the hull, the checker sees 10 piercing pairs and
bbox height 39.95; 0 puts it on the skin to 7.6e-7 and the checker sees 4
coplanar contact pairs, which an air gap never produces.

**Known limits.** The plug frame picks the punch axis from the hull, so the
bit must sit roughly over the target face (Center X / Z first). On a curved
hull the seat tilts the bit through `mesh.quaternion`, which the export
transform chain (rotY / tip / roll) does not carry - a flat target is exact,
a tilted gap seat exports untilted. The two-shell touching case (gap 0)
reads as piercing pairs in `mesh_validate.py` because the checker has no
"touching along an edge" class; it is the coplanar count that separates
touching from an air gap.
