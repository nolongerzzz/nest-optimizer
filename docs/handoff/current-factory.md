## Current factory (do not rewrite from this file)
Live HUD is `inside3`. Finish wrap + paint + pocket bake is the open factory path.
CTH is gated (`?cth=1` / `?cth=finish` / `?cth=drive`) and removable.
Parked modules (repair, sculpt, planar fuse, path sweep) stay unwired until the owner names a ticket.
Clean no-op mesh for repair checks is `fixtures/box-20mm.stl`, not Thingi10K 40921
(40921 has 17 bowtie vertices; edge-based checks miss that).
