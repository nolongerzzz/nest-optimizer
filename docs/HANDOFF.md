# Handoff (Claude Code reads this. User does not paste code.)

Branch: `claude-wip` only. Never push `main`.

**PR #4 is closed and already on main** (corners1, 2026-09-08, squash `4ea5eca`).
Do not reopen it. Do not comment on it. Do not treat it as a drop box.
New work: commit on `claude-wip`. Open a **new** PR if a review surface is needed.
Grok merges `claude-wip` → `main` and owns HUD / `?v=` tags.

## Output protocol
1. Findings, numbers, diffs, and next-step proposals go in the current ticket PR
   (a new PR off `claude-wip`) or in the commit message. Never PR #4.
2. Chat carries a short status line. No full script dumps. No `app.js` token.
3. Never apply `stash@{0}` or any parked patch unless Grok or this file says **APPLY**.
4. Never bump `?v=` tags — Grok owns the HUD string (`stampHud()` in the UX script).
5. Pass/fail is math: `tools/stl_watertight_check.py --odd --degen` plus the
   geometry probes the current ticket names. Never call a mesh correct from a screenshot.

## Ping pong
A bare STL drop, no text, is the latest live export for the current ticket.

- Run the checker and the ticket probes.
- Commit or comment on the **current** ticket PR.
- Ticket fails → one scoped patch on `claude-wip`, then a short status line.
- Ticket passes every named gate → comment "this is correct" with the numbers, no further patch.
- A decision is needed → one question, then `I need your attention`.

## Current factory (do not rewrite from this file)
Live HUD is `inside4`. Finish wrap + paint + pocket bake is the open factory path.
CTH is gated (`?cth=1` / `?cth=finish` / `?cth=drive`) and removable.
Parked modules (repair, sculpt, planar fuse) stay unwired until the owner names a ticket.
Clean no-op mesh for repair checks is `fixtures/box-20mm.stl`, not Thingi10K 40921
(40921 has 17 bowtie vertices; edge-based checks miss that).

## CTH checks
`npm run cth:unit` is the dependency-free suite (`tools/cth-test/*.test.mjs`,
also runnable as `./tools/cth-test/run-all.sh`). `npm run cth:capture` drives the
real app in headless Chromium and needs `npm ci`. `npm test` runs both. The
capture check serves three from the `three` devDependency rather than the CDN
`index.html` names, so it needs no network.

## Parked ticket - re-vendor cth/ from click-test
`cth/` is a vendored fork of `nolongerzzz/click-test` `src/`, and it has
drifted: 55-278 changed lines per file. Two regressions have already been
traced to the vendoring rather than to upstream - `escapeHtml` had its entity
map HTML-decoded, so only the apostrophe was escaped, and the overlay lost
upstream's always-a-list `renderAims()`. Both are fixed here now; the overlay's
completion-only summary is a deliberate divergence for the corner card, not
drift, and should stay.

Do NOT blanket-overwrite `cth/` from upstream. Some of the drift is intentional
nest-specific work. This needs a deliberate file-by-file review deciding, for
each hunk, whether it is a nest change to keep or vendoring damage to drop.

## Archive — Soften Corners second pass (corners2), historical

corners1 was measured on the exported STL of the live FAIL. What it actually
built, on the 12.38 x 20 x 20 baked half at R=2.5:

- All FOUR cap-loop corners carried an arc of exactly radius 2.5 (tangent at
  7.5 on each edge, centres at (+/-7.5, +/-7.5)). Watertight, 0 open, 0
  non-manifold. So "one pair only" is not in the mesh — but the shape was
  still wrong, in two ways that explain what it looked like:
- **Orbit-point.** The corner surface converged radially on the ORIGINAL
  sharp apex at depth 1.0355 — every rollover sample ran to one vertex, so
  the corner is a cone apex, not a fillet. From any camera off the face
  normal it reads as a point.
- **Bite too small.** corners1 rounded the lid boundary in plan with radius
  R but only cut the wall back by R/sin(45) - R = 0.4142 R. At R=2.5 that is
  a 1.04mm bite where 2.5mm was asked.

corners2 put Corners back through `rawEdgeRoundInPlace`. That work is already
on main as later corners tickets. Do not re-open it from this archive.

### Known, not current
`branch point in cap boundary` still refuses some cut faces (parked
`stash@{0}`) — Round, Bevel and Corners all refuse there identically.
`stash@{0}` stays parked until an explicit **APPLY**.

## Sculpt tier 1 — vertex adjacency + global smoothing (landed, `app-sculpt.js`)

Full write-up with numbers: `docs/SCULPT-TIER1.md`. Self-test:
`node tools/sculpt_selftest.js`. Script tag added to `index.html` at the
existing `?v=inside3` — tag NOT bumped.

State: both tiers built and measured. Topology invariance verified on every
fixture (same vertex count, triangle count, connectivity; only positions
move). Global Laplacian has no feature preservation and no way to protect a
region — that is the brush tier, and nothing in `app-sculpt.js` should grow
a feature term.

Three findings land on code this ticket did NOT touch. They matter for the
merge-order pass because each is someone else's gate:

1. `NSO_weldEpsFor` (app-join.js) caps the weld tolerance at the strict
   minimum edge, so a handful of slivers set the tolerance for a whole mesh.
   On the tape fixture 2 edges out of 98,586 drag it to 5e-6 and the part
   reads as 1402 open edges; it welds to V-E+F 2, 0 open at 3e-5.
   `NSO_sculptWeldTol` in app-sculpt.js carries the fix. Both booleans still
   run the old rule.
2. `NSO_edgeStats` and `rawCheckWatertightQuick` weld by coordinate
   rounding, so neither can see a backwards-wound face: it pairs every edge
   and reads 0 open while the volume is wrong. `NSO_buildAdjacency` counts
   directed edges (`stackedDirs`) and requires 0 for watertight. This is a
   second, distinct hole alongside the already-parked 208-odd-edge tolerance.
3. `tools/stl_watertight_check.py` rounds to 1e-5, too tight for a float32
   STL of an 82mm part: it reports 1406 false open edges on the tape fixture.

None of the three touched — each wants its own scoped pass and an APPLY.
